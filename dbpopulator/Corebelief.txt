I’m worthless.
I’m unlovable.
I’m incompetent.
I have messed up most of the important relationship I’ve ever had.
I can’t do anything right.
I hate myself.
Bad things happen to me a lot.
I am guilty of a great many things.
I am faced with many difficulties.
I have serious flaws in my character.
I’m inferior to others.
I’m socially awkward.
I don’t fit in.
People don’t tend to like me
The world is a very unhelpful place. Nobody cares about others.
My family doesn’t care what happens to me.
No matter what I do, others make if difficult for me to get what I need.
People are critical of others.
In social situations people are always forming evaluations of each other.
There is nothing left in my life to look forward to.
There is no reason for me to be hopeful about my future.
My future is simply too awful to think about.
