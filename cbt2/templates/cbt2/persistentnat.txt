My life is a mess.
I’m a failure.
I’ll never make it.
I feel so helpless.
Something has to change.
There must be something wrong with me.
My future is bleak.
It’s just not worth it.
I can’t finish anything.
I feel like I’m up against the world.
I’m of no good.
Why can’t I ever succeed?
No one understands me.
I’ve let people down.
I don’t think I can go on.
I wish I were a better person.
I’m so weak.
My life’s not going the way I want it to.
I’m so disappointed in myself.
Nothing feels good anymore.
I can’t stand this anymore.
I can’t get started.
What’s wrong with me?
I wish I were somewhere else./ I should’ve been somewhere else.
I can’t get things done.
I hate myself.
I’m worthless.
Wish I could just disappear.
What’s the matter with me?
I’m a loser.
I am very boring and nobody wants to hangout with me.
I have no self-control at all.
I feel very dependent on others.
I’m too tired.
I won’t enjoy it.
My friends won’t want to spend time with me. 
I won’t be able to do it.
I plan to rest until I start feeling upbeat.
Nothing can help me feel better.
I’m doing a terrible job.
I should have done this long ago.
I don’t deserve to be doing this.
There’s still so much left to do.I can’t do this as well as I used to.
This used to be more fun.
Nobody cares about me.
I must be ugly, because men don’t ask me out./ I must be ugly because girls don’t talk to me.
